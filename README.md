# ✨ Awesome Cognitively-Kind Web

> A hand-curated directory of websites designed to be gentle on the mind. These resources prioritize **quality, slow consumption, and human authorship**, ensuring a positive, high-signal browsing experience that leaves you feeling informed, not drained.

## 🌟 Core Philosophy: The Anti-Algorithm Standard

A website is deemed "Cognitively-Kind" only if it adheres to these principles:

1.  **NO Algorithm:** Content is delivered based on **explicit user choice** (e.g., following a link, visiting a static category page, or chronologically) and **never** via a proprietary feed, "For You" page, or recommendation engine designed to maximize time-on-site.
2.  **Human-Generated, currated as much as possible:** Content is verifiably **created and maintained by human thought and effort, not complete AI slop**.
3.  **Low-Distraction Design:** Minimalist layout, no intrusive ads, no auto-play media, and a complete absence of infinite scrolling.
4.  **High-Signal, Low-Noise:** Content is substantial, educational, or genuinely interesting, free from sensationalism, manufactured outrage, or clickbait.
